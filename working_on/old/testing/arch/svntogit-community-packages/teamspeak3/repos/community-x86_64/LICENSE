Framework license agreement for the installation of the TeamSpeak client

This License Agreement ("Agreement") is effective between "you", the person or company who/which is using software branded TeamSpeak, developed by TeamSpeak Systems GmbH ("TeamSpeak"), and TeamSpeak Systems GmbH (Germany) with installation of the TeamSpeak client.

## I. Definitions

  1. "Standard Software" means the object code of the TeamSpeak voice communication software version 3.x (binary executable), and all previous versions, both client and server, which is provided by TeamSpeak, including all standard software enhancements, upgrades or updates, which you will receive if and when they are made available.

  3. "Client" refers to the TeamSpeak standard software which connects to the TeamSpeak server software via computer network or the Internet. The client therefore usually runs on the end user's computer. A client can connect to one or more servers at the same time. Multiple clients communicate with each other by routing the communication data through the server, which distributes them to other clients. Clients thus do not connect directly to each other, but always connect only to the server that acts as an intermediary and distributor for voice communication.
