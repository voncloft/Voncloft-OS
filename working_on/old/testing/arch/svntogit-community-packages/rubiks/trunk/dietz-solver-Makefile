# Makefile for cubex by Eric
# This Makefile was seriously broken.
# CC was set to g++. Since it was compiling C++ files,
# CXX should have been used.
# LINK was set to g++, so I changed that to LD
# CFLAGS was set to -O2. I've removed that, so it can be set
# in spkg-install.
# In any case, it should have been CXXFLAGS
# LFLAGS and INCLUDES were both empty
