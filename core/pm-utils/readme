Kernel Configuration:

If needed, enable the following options in the kernel configuration and recompile the
kernel:

Power management and ACPI options --->
    <*> Suspend to RAM and standby            [CONFIG_SUSPEND]
    <*> Hibernation (aka 'suspend to disk')   [CONFIG_HIBERNATION]


Suspend to RAM allows the system to enter sleep states in which main memory is
powered and thus its contents are preserved. The method cuts power to most parts of
the machine aside from the RAM. Because of the large power savings, it is advisable
for laptops to automatically enter this mode when the computer is running on
batteries and the lid is closed (or the user is inactive for some time).

Suspend to disk (Hibernation) saves the machine's state into swap space and
completely powers off the machine. When the machine is powered on, the state is
restored. Until then, there is zero power consumption. Suspend to RAM and hibernation
are normally appropriate for portable devices such as laptops, but can be used on
workstations. The capability is not really appropriate for servers.

To use hibernation, the kernel parameter resume=/dev/<swap_partition> has to be
used on the kernel command line (in grub.cfg). The swap partition should be at least
the size of the physical RAM on the system.
