# Voncloft-OS - Personal LFS build

A Linux From Scratch Repository that I self maintain.

_As of 05-11-2021_

**Update:**
- Cinnamon has been put on hold as of 4/5 - due to systemd dependencies, which I am doubting whether or not to use
- work on all universal user passes on vpn

**Needs Testing:**
- qtcreator
- postfix
- mythtv
- python - might have errors will fix as a need be basis
- perl - might have errors will fix as a need be basis
- kde - needs testing
- chessx - needs testing and its dependencies
- scid_vs_pc - needs testing

**Programs to be added in the future:**
- None at the moment

**Other:**
- Everything in workbench is files that continuously get changed and tarballed for later
- Everything in working_on/sort_later needs to be tested.
- Will use a spare PC to test everything on or a virtual box
- Template folder is a base for all packages as of 3/16/21
- Packages are checked six times a day in my repository against https://distrowatch.com/packages.php (amongst other scripts located in Utilities/custom_progs) using a script located in utilities/bin/checkrepository

**Misc:**
