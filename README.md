A Linux From Scratch Repository that I self maintain.

No major plans to update repository except for occasionaly python packages (all of them were built using a script
some errors may be present will fix as a need be basis)

Done:

mythtv - needs testing

clementine

python - might have errors will fix as a need be basis

perl - might have errors will fix as a need be basis

kodi - needs testing

kde - needs testing

Other:

Everything in working_on/sort_later needs to be tested.

Will use a spare PC to test everything on or a virtual box
