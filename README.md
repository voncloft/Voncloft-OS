**_Update:_**
**No major plans to update repository except for occasionaly python packages (all of them were built using a script
some errors may be present will fix as a need be basis)**

**_Done_:**
- mythtv - needs testing
- clementine
- python - might have errors will fix as a need be basis
- perl - might have errors will fix as a need be basis
- kodi - needs testing
- kde - needs testing

**_Other:_**

- Will use a spare PC to test everything on or a virtual box
