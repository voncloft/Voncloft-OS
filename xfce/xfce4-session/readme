Configuring Xfce4 Session:

There are several optional run time dependencies for Xfce4: ConsoleKit2-1.0.2,
dbus-1.10.14, GnuPG-2.1.18, hicolor-icon-theme-0.15 and OpenSSH-7.4p1

When building an Xfce4 package, some configuration files are installed in
/usr/share/applications, /usr/share/icons, and /usr/share/mime. In order to use
those files in your Xfce4 session, you need to update various databases. Do that
by running, as the root user (you need to have the recommended dependencies
installed):

	update-desktop-database &&
	update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

Starting Xfce4:

You can start Xfce4 from runlevel 3, using xinit-1.3.4, or from runlevel 5, using a
Display Manager, such as sddm-0.14.0.

To start Xfce4 using xinit-1.3.4, run the following commands:

	cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
	ck-launch-session dbus-launch --exit-with-session startxfce4
	EOF

	startx

The X session starts on the first unused virtual terminal, normally vt7. You can
switch to another vtn simultaneously pressing the keys Ctrl-Alt-Fn (n=1, 2, ...).
To switch back to the X session, normally started at vt7, use Ctrl-Alt-F7. The vt
where the command startx was executed will display many messages, including X
starting messages, applications automatically started with the session, and
eventually, some warning and error messages. You may prefer to redirect those
messages to a log file, which not only will keep the initial vt uncluttered,
but can also be used for debugging purposes. This can be done starting X with:

	startx &> ~/.x-session-errors

Note:

You may wish to drop consolekit and/or dbus-launch, e.g., just using startxfce4 in
~/.xinitrc. However some capabilities such as mounting or umounting file systems
from a file manager will not be possible, or the reboot option will be absent or
inoperative, among other problems.

When shutting down or rebooting, the shutdown messages appear on the vt where X was
running. If you wish to see those messages, simultaneously press keys Alt-F7
(assuming that X was running on vt7).
