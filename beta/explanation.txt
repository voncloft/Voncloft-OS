kde/kde5 - full meta of kde desktop
kde/kdedeps - meta of all dependencies for kde5 to event continue references kf5 and plasma depends
kf5/kf5-depends - meta of all kf5 depends
plasma/plasma-depends - meta of all plasma depends
kf5/kf5-programs - all kf5 programs in the kde desktop making sure depends are satisfied first in kde5
plasma/plasma-programs - all plasma programs in the kde desktop making sure depends are satisfied first in kde5

kde/kde-deps-installer - a quick and easy hack to install programs for kde

each program in plasma and kf5 will need kde-deps for a dependency 

Basically I want to blanket kf5 dependencies first and all plasma programs second before moving onto individual packages so 
if I want to install kate....on a brand new system it would need to do the following:

Find kate's dependencies

it should come back and say kde-deps

kde-deps would say it needs kde-deps-installer which would install the programs to compile both kf5 and plasma packages
then it would need kf5-depends and plasma-deps which would go thru them in that particular order to grab a bunch of crap creating a "blank
slate" for other programs to be installed 

then the base of kde would be completed and should be okay to install kate 

When all is done: delete KDE from maing branch

make the following
kf5 - keep kf5 spkgbuild's here 
plasma - keep all plasma spkgbuild's here
kde - shouldn't have much its just the gateway for kf5 and plasma should only have the 'primer' to start a full blown installation and the 
toolkit for the packages

Version sheming:
kde/kde5/spkgbuild - only the version will drop the decimal for example kf5 and plasma5 ...its gonna be version 5
kf5/kf5*/spkgbuild - version will include decimal
plasma/plasma*/spkgbuild - will include decimal 


use plasmapackageinstaller for plasma and apps
kf5 for kf5 frameworks
