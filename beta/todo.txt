for each plasma package it will need to have plasma-depends as the depends
for each kf5 package it will need to have kf5-depends as the depends

Basically get the "crap" out of the way before moving on to any packages for kde to begin with.

use a for loop script like you did for python and perl and for each kf5 and plasma package put the corresponding installer in the command line followed by make DESTDIR=$PKG install

work on 'm' packages for depends of either packages
