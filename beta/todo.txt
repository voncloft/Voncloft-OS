for each plasma package it will need to have plasma-depends as the depends
for each kf5 package it will need to have kf5-depends as the depends

Basically get the "crap" out of the way before moving on to any packages for kde to begin with.

Try to create a program called kde-install where it will PKG everythin up.....or you can do a for loop like you did for python or perl

work on 'm' packages for depends of either packages
