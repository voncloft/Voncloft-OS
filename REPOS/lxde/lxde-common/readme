Starting LXDE:

You can start LXDE from runlevel 3, using xinit-1.3.4, or from runlevel 5, using a
Display Manager, such as lxdm-0.5.3.
To start LXDE using xinit-1.3.4, run the following commands:

	cat > ~/.xinitrc << "EOF"
	# No need to run dbus-launch, since it is run by startlxde
	ck-launch-session startlxde
	EOF

	startx


The X session starts on the first unused virtual terminal, normally vt7. You can
switch to another vtn simultaneously pressing the keys Ctrl-Alt-Fn (n=1, 2, ...). To
switch back to the X session, normally started at vt7, use Ctrl-Alt-F7. The vt where
the command startx was executed will display many messages, including X starting
messages, applications automatically started with the session, and eventually, some
warning and error messages. You may prefer to redirect those messages to a log file,
which not only will keep the initial vt uncluttered, but can also be used for debug
purposes. This can be done starting X with:

	startx &> ~/.x-session-errors

Note:

You may wish to drop consolekit, just using startlxde in ~/.xinitrc. However some
capabilities such as mounting or umounting file systems from a file manager will
not be available, or the reboot option will be absent or inoperative, 
among other problems.

When shutting down or rebooting, the shutdown messages appear on the vt where X was
running. If you wish to see those messages, simultaneously press keys Alt-F7
(assuming that X was running on vt7).
