Config Files:

The default and individual user gpm-root configuration files:
	/etc/gpm-root.conf
	~/.gpm-root

Edit this file as the root user and modify the name of your mouse
device and the protocol it uses:

   /etc/conf.d/gpm


Configuration Information:

Examples of values to set MDEVICE, PROTOCOL, and GPMOPTS to are:

MDEVICE="/dev/input/mice"
PROTOCOL="imps2"
GPMOPTS=""

A list of which protocol values are known can be found by running
gpm -m [device] -t -help. The MDEVICE setting depends on which type of mouse you
have. For example, /dev/ttyS0 for a serial mouse (on Windows this is COM1),
/dev/input/mice is often used for USB mice and /dev/psaux for PS2 mice. GPMOPTS is
the 'catch all' for any additional options that are needed for your hardware.
