Kernel Configuration:

Getting your kernel config right is an iterative process that may require that you
recompile your kernel a couple of times. The simplest way to go about it is to start
by enabling modules and then compile everything that may be needed by Lm Sensors as
a module:

	[*] Enable loadable module support  --->  [CONFIG_MODULES]

	Bus options (PCI etc.)  --->
	  [*] PCI support                         [CONFIG_PCI]

	Device Drivers  --->
	  I2C support --->
	    <*/M> I2C device interface            [CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV]
	    I2C Hardware Bus support  --->
	      <M> (configure all of them as modules)
	  <*/M> Hardware Monitoring support  ---> [CONFIG_HWMON]
	    <M> (configure all of them as modules)

Recompile your kernel and reboot into the new kernel. Don't forget to make
modules_install We will come back to the kernel in the Configuring section below.
